# Inventory List

This simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) table frontend web application allows users to view and manage a list of items in a table format. The table can be sorted and searched, and each item has options to view, edit, or delete. This application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be easily integrated with a backend API to connect to a database.

Users can:

View the table with all items.
Search the table by keywords.
Sort the table by different columns.
View, edit and delete an item.


Please note that the application is a simple frontend, it has to be integrated with a backend to perform the CRUD operations.
